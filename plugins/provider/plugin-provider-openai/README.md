# @tinyclaw/plugin-provider-openai

OpenAI provider plugin for Tiny Claw. Adds OpenAI as an LLM provider, enabling the agent to use GPT models.

## Setup

1. Obtain an API key from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>
2. Ask the agent to pair the OpenAI provider
3. Provide the API key when prompted

## How It Works

- Registers an OpenAI-compatible provider with the agent
- API key is stored securely via the secrets engine
- Supports model selection through the agent's model management tools
