# Tiny Claw Contributor License Agreement

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** February 16, 2026

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Tiny Claw** (the "Project"), maintained by **Waren Gonzaga** (the "Maintainer"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Maintainer. This is a legally binding document, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it.

## Why a CLA?

Tiny Claw is built on the belief that AI should be accessible to everyone. To keep the project **open source forever** while also making it **sustainable long-term**, the Maintainer offers a dual-licensing model - free under GPL-3.0, with an optional commercial license for companies that need it. Revenue from commercial licenses goes directly into funding development, infrastructure, and keeping Tiny Claw free for the community.

The CLA ensures the Maintainer has the necessary rights to offer both licenses without legal ambiguity. Without a CLA, open source projects can find themselves legally unable to evolve their licensing to meet sustainability needs - as seen with projects like OpenClaw, where the lack of contributor agreements made it impossible to offer a commercial license later. We don't want to repeat that mistake. The CLA also signals that you're a **serious contributor** who understands and supports the project's mission. This isn't red tape - it's how we protect both the project and its contributors while building something that can grow and thrive for years to come.

## 1. Definitions

- **"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this Agreement. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You.
- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that You intentionally submit to the Project for inclusion in or documentation of the Project. "Submit" means any form of communication sent to the Project, including but not limited to pull requests, issues, patches, and commits submitted via GitHub or any other electronic means.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

This patent license applies to all license terms under which the Project is distributed, including any commercial license offered by the Maintainer.

## 4. Representations

You represent that:

- **(a)** Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and You have the legal right to submit it under this Agreement.
- **(b)** Your Contribution does not violate any third party's intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets.
- **(c)** If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project.
- **(d)** You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights.

## 5. Third-Party Content

If any part of Your Contribution includes or is based on work from a third party, You must:

- **(a)** Identify the third-party content and its origin.
- **(b)** Include all applicable license terms and attributions.
- **(c)** Ensure the third-party content is compatible with the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).

## 6. Dual Licensing

The Project uses a **dual-licensing** model:

- **(a) Open Source License.** The Project is and will remain available under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)** or a later version as published by the Free Software Foundation. The Maintainer commits to always making the Project available under this open source license.
- **(b) Commercial License.** The Maintainer may also offer the Project (including Your Contributions) under a separate **commercial license** for organizations or individuals who wish to use the Project without the obligations of the GPL-3.0 (e.g., the copyleft requirement). Revenue from commercial licenses supports the continued development and maintenance of the Project.

By signing this Agreement, You acknowledge and agree that Your Contributions may be distributed under both the GPL-3.0 open source license and a commercial license offered by the Maintainer. You understand that You will not receive royalties or other compensation from commercial licensing of the Project.

## 8. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in the Project is entirely at the discretion of the Maintainer and that this Agreement does not create any obligation on the part of the Maintainer to use or incorporate Your Contribution.

## 9. Notification

You agree to notify the Maintainer of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

## 10. Agreement

By submitting a Contribution to this Project, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Contributor License Agreement.
